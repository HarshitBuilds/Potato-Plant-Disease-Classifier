# Potato Plant Disease Classifier
Project involved using Computer Vision techniques to classify the given image dataset of potato leaves into three classes of Healthy leaves, Early Blight and Late Blight affected leaves.
 
 • Applied RESNET9 as the neural network architecture for creating our image classifier model.
 
 • Implemented techniques such as data augmentation and early stopping to enhance model performance. Stochastic Gradient Descent with training set batch size of 32 was used to train the model.
 
 • Achieved final validation accuracy of 97.3% with F1 score of 0.91 for the Healthy class
